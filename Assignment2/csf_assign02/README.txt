Partners: Ricardo Morales Gonzalez, Ana Kuri

We both worked on the homework at the same time by gettin on a zoom call and getting one
person (Ricardo) to be the scribe, the writer of code, and the other person (Ana) to develop
the logic to be written and checking visually for syntax and logic erros. In this way, we
both were able to contribute in equal parts to the completion of the project essentially writing
all functions and code together.

Individual contributions were done in the form of fixing bugs on each person's free time as well
as adding comments to code. But this was not done in a substantial manner, and most of the code was
written while on a zoom call together.
